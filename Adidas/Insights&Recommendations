With female customers contributing the most to sales, prioritize marketing strategies aimed at this segment, perhaps focusing on preferred product lines like street footwear and apparel, which have shown high engagement and profitability.
### 7. Monitor Gender-Based Average Order Value for Upselling Opportunities
With men showing a higher average order value, implement upselling strategies in targeted campaigns, especially around products like street footwear where demand is already high.
